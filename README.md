# ðŸŒ  About Me:
Hello there! I'm Loshanth but you can call me Losh. I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with a strong foundation in Advanced Mechanical Engineering. My coding journey began out of sheer curiosity and I can report that all nine of my lives are still intact (there's a joke in there somewhere, if you look hard enough).<br><br>Recently, I completed a rigorous coding bootcamp with the esteemed Bright Network Technology Academy (BNTA). The experience was truly transformative, providing me with invaluable knowledge and skills that I am eager to apply to real-world projects.<br><br>Currently I'm planning out a few individual and team based projects that I'd like to start, now that I've got a bit more time on my hands. <br><br>My life outside of coding includes: Hiking, Martial arts and Exploring the natural beauties of the world.<br><br>Here's a joke for you:<br>Why did the programmer visit the opticians?<br>.....because he couldn't C# <br>
